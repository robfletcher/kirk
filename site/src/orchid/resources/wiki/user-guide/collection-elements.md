# Assertions on elements of a collection

Some assertions on collections include sub-assertions applied to the elements of the collection.
For example, we can assert that _all_ elements conform to a repeated assertion.

{% codesnippet key='collections_1' testClass='Assertions' %} 

This produces the output:

{% codesnippet key='collections_2' testClass='Assertions' %}

The results are broken down by individual elements in the collection so it's easy to see which failed.

Similarly, `any` asserts that at least one element passes the nested assertions and `none` succeeds if all elements of the collection _fail_ the nested assertions.
