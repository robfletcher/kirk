Strikt does not depend on any particular test runner.
It can be used with JUnit, Spek or any other runner that supports tests written in Kotlin.

== Installation

Strikt is available from JCenter.
Add the following to your `build.gradle`.

[source,groovy]
----
repositories { 
  jcenter() 
}

dependencies {
  testCompile "io.strikt:strikt-core:0.6.0"
}
----

== Importing the Strikt API

Add the following imports to your test:

[source,kotlin]
----
import strikt.api.*
import strikt.assertions.*
----

The `strikt.api` package contains top level functions such as `expect` and `throws` that you will use to create assertions as well as the API classes you will interact with if you decide to implement your own assertion functions.
The `strikt.assertions` package contains the standard library of assertion functions.
